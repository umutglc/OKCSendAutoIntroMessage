# OKCSendAutoIntroMessage
Automaticly send intro message to everyone you liked on OKCupid.

# How to run
Although I said "Automaticly", I'm bit lazy and you have some things to do manually.
It could be a bit hard if you are not into web programming but if you follow the steps bellow, it shouldn't be a problem.
#### First Step: Get request cookie
Go to "[You Like](https://www.okcupid.com/who-you-like?cf=likesIncoming)" section on OKC, click one of the persons you like.

Open up the browser console (usually F12, right click on the page then inspect also works), go to network tab (pointed with green -You might have to expand and select from the right side; pointed with orange). Click "MESSAGE" to send a message.

This will pop-up. Now just before you send the message, click "Clear" Button (Yellow arrow from the picture above). Then send the message.
